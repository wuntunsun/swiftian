//    In the horizontal case, regular applies to all iPads in full screen as well as some iPhones in landscape,
//    compact applies to all iPhones in portrait and most iPhones in landscape along with some iPad multitasking configurations,
//    and unspecified is the case where it is not yet determined.

    // a Table in a .compact horizontalSizeClass will only display the first column
    // SwiftUI does not use constraints, uses modifiers instead...
    
    // https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/reducing-view-modifier-maintenance
    // create ViewModifier and apply with .modifier to apply it
    // its body function is also a @ViewBuilder but body(content: Content) rather than @ViewBuilder @MainActor var body: Self.Body { get }
    // an EmptyModifier() is a placeholder that can be switched at compile time...
    // an EnvironmentalModifier() will be resolved from the environment before use.
    // EquatableView compares itself against its previous value and prevents its child updating if its new value is the same as its old value (efficiency?)
    // SubscriptionView subscribes to a publisher with an action (cut out boiletplate code)
    // TupleView created from a swift tuple of View values
    // There are View styles... appropriate style for a particular presentation context. For example, a Label might appear as an icon, a string title, or both, depending on factors like the platform, whether the view appears in a toolbar, and so on
    // There are LazyHStack and LazyVStack whereby their contents are created lazily. Wrap in ScrollView to make scrollable.
    // PinnedScrollableViews set of view types that may be pinned to the bounds of a scroll view.
    // There are LazyVGrid and LazyHGrid which perform better than Grid with larger data sets. Uses GridItem...
    // List includes implicit vertical scrolling
    // Table includes implicit vertical scrolling, Narrow displays may adapt to show only the first column of the table
    //  slide-over on iPad and Mac is supported by Table... i.e. .compact horizontalSizeClass shows first column...
    // Group and GroupBox, Form is for data-entry, ControlGroup provide an optional label to this view that describes its children - SwiftUI uses the label when the group is moved to the toolbarâ€™s overflow menu
    // NavigationStack and NavigationSplitView replaced NavigationView in iOS 16, they devolve to a 'stack' on .compact horizontalSizeClass
    //
    
    var body: some Scene { // @SceneBuilder, see also @CommandsBuilder, @ViewBuilder
